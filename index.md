Stanislav Fomichev
==================

In the age of social web it's not common to have a homepage. But since I mainly use this domain for my mailbox and I don't like the idea of having empty page I decided to put some information about me here.

I am CS student at [National research nuclear university MEPhI](http://mephi.ru/eng/) in Moscow. I also do full-time job at [EPSCom](http://epscom.net) as an Embedded Software Engineer. In my spare time I occasionally [contribute](http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux%2Fkernel%2Fgit%2Fnext%2Flinux-next.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=Stanislav+Fomichev) to the Linux kernel.
